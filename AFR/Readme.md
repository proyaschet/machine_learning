AMAZON FINE FOOD REVIEWS

I have used AMAZON FINE FOOD REVIEWS Dataset to filter data and simultaneously used the following techniques yo convert  word to vector
1) Bag of Words
2) Tf-Idf
3) Avg - W2V
4) Tf-Idf - W2V

To vizualize high dimensionality data in low dimension I have used TSNE.

In the first Notebook I have followed all the necesssary preprocessing technique which you can find in the Notebook as it is well commented and have used the sql file obtained from kaggle dataset
After the preprocessing step I have saved the filtered data in the Final sqlite db.


Logistic Regression
1) Applied Logistic regression to classify the data based on the review wether it is a positive or negative dataset.
2) Since the data is imbalanced I have used weighted method to built an unbiased model
3) YOu can view the implementation in AFR-LR notebook
