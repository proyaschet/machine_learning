AMAZON FINE FOOD REVIEWS

I have used AMAZON FINE FOOD REVIEWS Dataset to filter data and simultaneously use word to vector technique to vizualize high dimension data in a low dimension
Techniques to vecctorize includes 
1) Bag of Words
2) Tf-Idf
3) Avg - W2V
4) Tf-Idf - W2V

To vizualize high dimensionality data in low dimension I have used TSNE.

In the first Notebook I have followed all the necesssary preprocessing technique which you can find in the Notebook as it is well commented and have used the sql file obtained from kaggle dataset
After the preprocessing step I have saved the filtered data in the Final sqlite db.

Below you can find the link for the dataset
